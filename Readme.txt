Welcome to Box2D-OpenCL

We have accelerated the entire rigid body pipeline of Box2D 2.2.1 using OpenCL.  
Please refer to the file Instruction.docx for detailed setup and build instructions.  
Externally, the APIs of Box2D-OpenCL are identical to Box2D ver 2.2.1.  
We have accelerated the following stages of the rigid body pipeline in Box2D-OpenCL:

* Broad Phase
* Narrow Phase
* Solver 

We welcome comments and contributions from the community.  

For the sequential Box2D 2.2.1 implementation, please refer to:
