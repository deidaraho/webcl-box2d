Welcome to Box2D-OpenCL

We have accelerated the rigid body pipeline of Box2D 2.2.1 using OpenCL.  
Please refer to the file Instruction.docx for detailed setup and build instructions.  
Externally, the APIs of Box2D-OpenCL are identical to Box2D ver 2.2.1.  
We have accelerated the following stages of the rigid body pipeline in Box2D-OpenCL:

* Broad Phase
* Narrow Phase
* Solver 

We welcome comments and contributions from the community.  

For the sequential Box2D 2.2.1 implementation, please refer to:
